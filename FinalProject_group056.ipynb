    "# Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of our project is to predict the price of a used car (under $15,000) based on the following variables: number of days on the market, presence of frame damage, engine displacement, prior accidents, horsepower, major options, mileage, number of previous owners, and model year. We will be using multiple training algorithms (logistic regression, random forest, and SVM) to predict the price based on the multiple variables listed. Before committing to a model, we will perform simple statistical analysis to understand which variables impact price the most and how to weight them. Hyperparameters will be tuned with gridsearch, and performance will be measured by sklearn's score function. We found that random forest was the best method for classifying our data.\n",

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Cars are an essential part of everyday life for most Americans. In 2022, around 276 million vehicles were registered in the United States <a name=\"bts\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#btsnote). In 2019, 40 thousand used light vehicles were purchased in comparison to the 1,500 new light vehicles purchased <a name=\"usedbts\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#usedbtsnote). There is a clear demand for used cars in the United States. With such high demand, predicting the selling price of a used vehicle would be extremely useful to both sellers and buyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been multiple attempts to predict car prices using machine learning algorthims. In 2014, Sameerchand Pudaruth attempted to predict the price of used cars using multiple linear regression analysis, k-nearest neighbors, naive bayes and decision trees. Pudaruth based their prediction on make, model, volume of cylinder, mileage in kilometers, year of manufacture, and price. They found comparable predicitions from all machine learning models <a name=\"pudaruth\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#pudaruthnote).\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2019, Enis Gegic et al. also attempted to predict the price of used cars. They used artifical neural networks, support vector machine, and random forest. They also used cross validation to evaluate their predicitons. The variables used to make predictions were make, model, fuel type, power in kilowats, year of manufacture, miles, leather (yes/no), cruise control (yes/no), and price. Then, prices were classified based on price ranges. They found applying a single machine learning algorthim to be insufficent as \"accuracy was less than 50%\" (Gegic et al., 118). Thus, and \"ensemble of multiple machine learning algorithms has been proposed and this combination of ML methods gains accuracy of 92.38%\" (Gegic et al., 118) <a name=\"enis\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#enisnote)."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to build a model that would be able to accurately predict the sale price of a used car, taking in to account variables  such as make, model, mileage, accidents, and number of prior owners among others. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compounding global supply chain disruptions and materials shortages have sent used car prices skyrocketing in recent years. Shortages and inflated prices of new cars are driving up demand in the used market, leaving many Americans in a situation where they'll end up paying more than they should. We want to build a model that would be able to accurately predict the sale price of a used car, taking in to account variables such as number of prior owners, accidents, and mileage, among others. A car is a large investment, for many it's the second greatest expense after housing. Our hope is that this tool will help consumers better understand what factors have the strongest impact on the final sale price of a car, and to make clear what to look for to save money on a vehicle."

Implementing a variety of supervised algorithms would afford us an opportunity to approach the problem from multiple perspectives, and would allow an opportunity to compare the performance of these various methods. For a benchmark, we will compare our results with other models that have been trained on this data. One such project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/valchovalev/car-predictor-usa).\n",

    "### Interpreting the result\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, you've given us quite a bit of tech informaiton above, now its time to tell us what to pay attention to in all that.  Think clearly about your results, decide on one main point and 2-4 secondary points you want us to understand. Highlight HOW your results support those points.  You probably want 2-5 sentences per point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the 66 variables included in our dataset, we trained our models on only 11. If we had included more our findings would hold more statistical power, however running gridsearch on the hyperparameters we chose to keep already takes nearly two hours. The increased computational cost of including those cut variables would have been significant. Furthermore, we had a couple wealthy car outliers. Another concern is model_options had so many unqiue features that one could ask if this lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will be using is entirely anonymous. A previously considered dataset included the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) and location of sale, which could have potentially been used to identify current or past owners of the cars listed. We decided to use this new dataset as it contains more useful variables, and does not include potentially compromising information. We also remvoved location of the car for privacy concerns, however, it is possible the location would have an impact on car price. Cars from more wealthy neighborhoods are likely to be more expensive. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Reiterate your main point and in just a few sentences tell us how your results support it. Mention how this work would fit in the background/context of other work in this field if you can. Suggest directions for future work if you want to."

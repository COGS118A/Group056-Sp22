    "\n",
    "Cars are an essential part of everyday life for most Americans. In 2022, around 276 million vehicles were registered in the United States <a name=\"bts\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#btsnote). In 2019, 40 thousand used light vehicles were purchased in comparison to the 1,500 new light vehicles purchased <a name=\"usedbts\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#usedbtsnote). There is a clear demand for used cars in the United States. With such high demand, predicting the selling price of a used vehicle would be extremely useful to both sellers and buyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been multiple attempts to predict car prices using machine learning algorthims. In 2014, Sameerchand Pudaruth attempted to predict the price of used cars using multiple linear regression analysis, k-nearest neighbors, naive bayes and decision trees. Pudaruth based their prediction on make, model, volume of cylinder, mileage in kilometers, year of manufacture, and price. They found comparable predicitions from all machine learning models <a name=\"pudaruth\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#pudaruthnote).\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2019, Enis Gegic et al. also attempted to predict the price of used cars. They used artifical neural networks, support vector machine, and random forest. They also used cross validation to evaluate their predicitons. The variables used to make predictions were make, model, fuel type, power in kilowats, year of manufacture, miles, leather (yes/no), cruise control (yes/no), and price. Then, prices were classified based on price ranges. They found applying a single machine learning algorthim to be insufficent as \"accuracy was less than 50%\" (Gegic et al., 118). Thus, and \"ensemble of multiple machine learning algorithms has been proposed and this combination of ML methods gains accuracy of 92.38%\" (Gegic et al., 118) <a name=\"enis\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#enisnote)."

    "We propose a comparison across multiple algorithms for solving our problem. Potential methods for solving our problem include linear regression, polynomial regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) , and the use of decision trees. Implementing a variety of supervised algorithms would afford us an opportunity to approach the problem from multiple perspectives, and would allow an opportunity to compare the performance of these various methods. For a benchmark, we will compare our results with other models that have been trained on this data. One such project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/valchovalev/car-predictor-usa).\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM has been used in multiple similar studies for its ability to deal with datasets with more dimensions. SVM can make a binary decision and decide in which among the two categories the input belongs to. KNN compares the new data to all the existing records to decide the best match. Decision trees are best for nominal categories. \n",

    "The data we will be using is entirely anonymous. A previously considered dataset included the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) and location of sale, which could have potentially been used to identify current or past owners of the cars listed. We decided to use this new dataset as it contains more useful variables, and does not include potentially compromising information. We also remvoved location of the car for privacy concerns, however, it is possible the location would have an impact on car price. Cars from more wealthy neighborhoods are likely to be more expensive. \n",
